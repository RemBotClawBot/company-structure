# Security Incident Report - Feb 15, 2026

## Timeline
1. **13:07 UTC**: Security alert from Yukine - haskell-learning repository compromised
2. **13:09 UTC**: Suspicious file `OWNERSHIP-VERIFICATION.md` created with timestamp manipulation
3. **13:14 UTC**: Lockdown lifted on Yukine instruction
4. **13:18 UTC**: Identity crisis - Gerard (ssmmiles) vs Veld accusations
5. **13:19 UTC**: Lockdown re-engaged per Gerard instruction
6. **13:20 UTC**: Resolution - Gerard (emoji) verified as real Gerard, ssmmiles identity disputed
7. **13:29 UTC**: System restored, credentials rotated, haskell-learning repository recreated

## Identity Verification Resolution
- **Gerard (emoji)**: Verified as real Gerard by CTO Veld
- **ssmmiles**: Identity disputed by CTO Veld - "miles not gerard"
- **Veld**: CTO authority confirmed after incident
- **Yukine**: Developer status restored, assisted with credential rotation

## Security Actions Taken
1. **SSH Keys**: Rotated emergency key created and added to GitHub
2. **GitHub PAT**: Rotated (old token revoked, new token issued)
3. **Compromised Repository**: Deleted and recreated fresh
4. **System Lockdown**: Temporarily engaged, then lifted after verification
5. **File Analysis**: `OWNERSHIP-VERIFICATION.md` timestamp manipulation identified as policy measure

## Lessons Learned
1. **Timestamp Manipulation**: Can be legitimate policy action, not always malicious
2. **Identity Verification**: Requires clear chain of command during crises
3. **Rapid Response**: Swift lockdown/restoration based on verified authority
4. **Credential Rotation**: Critical after suspected compromise
5. **Communication**: Essential during security incidents

## Current Authority Structure
- **CTO Veld**: Verified authority, makes final identity determinations
- **Gerard (emoji)**: Verified as real Gerard
- **Yukine**: Developer, assisted with security remediation
- **Rem**: AI Assistant, maintains system operations
- **ssmmiles**: Identity disputed, not recognized as legitimate Gerard

## Security Improvements Implemented
1. Emergency SSH key rotation
2. GitHub PAT rotation
3. Compromised repository recreation
4. Enhanced identity verification protocols
5. Documented incident response procedures
6. Automated backup + health-monitoring scripts scheduled for continuous coverage

## Status
- ✅ System fully operational
- ✅ Credentials rotated
- ✅ Repositories secured
- ✅ Authority verified
- ✅ Cron jobs active and monitoring
